# WinMode – Overview

## Problem

Enterprise and commercial AEs juggle:
- Multiple deals
- Multiple stakeholders
- Multiple methodologies
- Limited time for prep and follow-up

The result: inconsistent qualification, missed signals, and deals stalling later than they should.

## What is WinMode?

WinMode is an AI assistant that sits alongside the rep and helps them think:

- Before calls – “What do I need to find out?”  
- After calls – “What’s missing and what should I do next?”  
- Across accounts – “Where are my risks and blind spots?”  

## Who it’s for

- AEs and AMs in B2B SaaS.  
- Sales managers running deal reviews.  
- Revenue teams that care about methodology but don’t want heavy admin.

## Key ideas

- **Framework-neutral**: supports MEDDPICC, MEDDIC, BANT, etc.  
- **AI as coach, not robot**: prompts thinking instead of replacing it.  
- **Low-friction**: outputs that can be quickly dropped into CRM notes or summaries.
