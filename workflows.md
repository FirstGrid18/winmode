# WinMode – Example Workflows

## Workflow 1 – Call Prep

1. Rep selects **“Prep for a call”**.
2. Inputs:
   - Account name
   - Deal stage
   - Persona they’re meeting
   - Short deal summary (optional)
3. WinMode returns:
   - Key objectives for the call.
   - Suggested questions by persona & stage.
   - A short checklist aligned to the chosen methodology.

## Workflow 2 – Post-Call Gap Check

1. Rep pastes quick call notes or bullets.
2. Chooses their framework (e.g. MEDDPICC).
3. WinMode:
   - Highlights which elements are strong / weak / missing.
   - Suggests follow-up questions and next steps.
4. Rep copies summary into CRM or email.

## Workflow 3 – Deal Review Support

1. Rep opens **“Deal review helper”**.
2. Enters basic deal context (value, stage, key stakeholders).
3. WinMode generates:
   - A structured view by methodology.
   - Three top risks.
   - Three concrete actions before the next meeting.

These workflows are meant to stay flexible so teams can adapt them to their own process.
