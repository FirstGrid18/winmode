# WinMode – Roadmap (High-Level)

## Phase 1 – Core Assistant

- ✅ Define core inputs (deal summary, stage, persona, notes).
- ✅ Build call prep guidance (questions by stage + persona).
- ✅ Post-call gap analysis against chosen framework.
- ☐ Suggested next steps and risks summary.

## Phase 2 – Account & Deal Views

- ☐ “Single account” view showing:
   - Key stakeholders by role.
   - Coverage gaps (economic buyer, champion, etc.).
- ☐ Deal snapshots for pipeline reviews.
- ☐ Simple export of summaries for CRM / email.

## Phase 3 – Team & Manager View

- ☐ Shared framework presets at team level.
- ☐ Manager-friendly deal review prompts.
- ☐ Insights on patterns (e.g. common missing fields, late-stage risk trends).

Priority: keep everything as lightweight and rep-friendly as possible.
